This script makes your URL shorter or print the number of clicks on your short URL

### How to install

Python3 should already be installed. 
Use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also, you should create file called `.env` and in it create a variable with your VK token called `VK_TOKEN`
